# Metacad Gym Environment
* This is a developmental stub

### Web Client Implementation:

socket.io logger as Thunk middleware hardcoded through ws://localhost:3001 picked up by python-socketio and eventlet WSGI (Web interface)

Connection tracks to window.location.hostname (from the browser's perspective on 3001)

## Backwards Direction

* SocketIO (Python) <- Socket.io <- React Client


## Forwards Direction
* Gym <-> Pyppeteer <-> Chrome Headless <- React
[Pyppeteer](https://pypi.org/project/pyppeteer/)
The initial idea of using OpenAI's Universe technology was scrapped with the realization that the overall complexity was far higher than anticipated. 
[Pyppeteer](https://miyakogi.github.io/pyppeteer/reference.html) was found as an appropriate substitute, based on the Nodejs API for Chrome [Puppeteer](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/puppeteer) , browser task automation was achieved.

## Putting it all together

## Further Development
We chose to convert Eventlet based programming into asyncio/uvicorn code to reduce dependency count and because of both of their presence in sample code. 

Pyppeteer should allow us to provide screencasting:
